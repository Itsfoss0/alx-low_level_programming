## About
Searching algorithms are a set of algorithms used to find a particular item in a collection of items. There are several types of searching algorithms available, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. In this project, we will explore the time and space complexity of the various searching algorithms implementations out there and discus the merrits and drawbacks of each.
