## Intro 
 Dynamic memory allocation is an important concept in C programming, allowing for efficient use of memory by allocating and freeing memory as needed. In this blog post, we will explore the use of the malloc function to dynamically allocate memory in C, including examples and best practices for proper usage

## About 
In this session, we well cover dyanamic memory allocation in C, why is it important and how it is implemted.
Buckle up, it might get bumpy!!

## Man/Help 

- malloc 
- free

## Learning objectives 
After going through the above resources, you should be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/) without the help of Goolge the following concepts.



* [X] What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation</li>
* [X] What is <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> and how to use them
* [X] Why and when use malloc
* [X] How to use valgrind to check for memory leak

## More info
You can learn about ```calloc``` and ```realloc```.
