<h1 align='center'>Function Pointers</h1>
<hr>

In this session, we will look at function pointers.

Remember in one of our [Sessions](https://github.com/Itsfoss0/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings) we introduced pointers.

We mentioned that pointer are just variables that store the address of other variables of the same type as that of the Pointer in memory. 

Lets Dive into it.
