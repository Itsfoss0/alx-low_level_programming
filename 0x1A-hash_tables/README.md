> Hash tables

## Intro
Hash tables are a fundamental data structure that are used in a wide range of applications, from databases to web browsers to programming languages. They are designed to efficiently store and retrieve data, and they are an essential tool for any developer who wants to write efficient and scalable software. In this session, we'll take a deep dive into hash tables, exploring how they work and how they can be used to solve common problems in computer science.
