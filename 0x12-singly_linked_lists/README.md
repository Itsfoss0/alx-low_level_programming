> Singly linked lists 

## Intro
In this session, we will look at Data structures and algorithims - Linked lists in particular. 

## About 
Data structures by definition is a way of storing, structuring and organizing data so it can be accessed, traversed, updated, used  and searched efficiently depending on the task at hand.  

Data structures can be divided into two - 
* Linear Data strucutes 
* Non linear Data structures 

Linear Data structures are those in which the data elements are stored in a sequential form, where each element is linked to the adjacent one.  Example include __arrays__, __linked List__, __stacks__ and __ques__. Linear Data structures can further be divided into static Data structures and Dymanic Data structures.

Non Linear Data strucutes on the other hand are Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only. Examples are __trees__ and __graphs__
