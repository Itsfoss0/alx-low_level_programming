## Intro 
__The power of ```typedef``` in C!__ In this session, we will focus on how ```typedef``` can be used to improve the readability and maintainability of your C code. We'll cover everything from the basics of typedef to advanced applications, and explore how it can be used to simplify complex data structures and make your code more intuitive. Buckle up as we demystify this often-underutilized feature of the C programming language
