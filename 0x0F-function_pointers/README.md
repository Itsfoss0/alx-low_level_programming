> Function Pointers

## Intro 
In this session, we will look at function pointers.

## About 
Remember in one of our [Sessions](https://github.com/Itsfoss0/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings) we introduced pointers.

We mentioned that pointer are just variables that store the address of other variables of the same type as that of the Pointer in memory. 

Lets Dive into it.

## Learning objectives 
At the end of this session, you should be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/) the following concepts without the help of Google

* [X] What are function pointers and how to use them
* [X] What does a function pointer exactly hold
* [X] Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory
