> Function pointer quizes


#### Question #0
What does a pointer to a function point to (check all correct answers if there is more than one)?

* [ ] The first character of the name of the function
* [ ] data
* [X] code
* [X] The first byte of code of the function


#### Question #1
To store the address of this function:

```c
void neyo(void);
```

to the variable f of type pointer to a function that does not take any argument and does not return anything, you would do (check all correct answers if there is more than one):

* [ ] *f = neyo;
* [X] f = neyo;
* [X] f = &neyo;
* [ ]*f = &neyo;

#### Question #3
Which one is a pointer to a function?

* [X] int (*func)(int a, float b);
* [ ] int func(int a, float b);
* [ ] int *func(int a, float b);
* [ ] (int *)func(int a, float b);
