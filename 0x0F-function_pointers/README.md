<h1 align='center'>Function Pointers</h1>
<hr>

In this session, we look at function pointers.

Remember in one of our [Sessions](https://github.com/Itsfoss0/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings) we introduced pointers.

We mentioned that pointer are just variables that store the address of other variables of the same type as that of the Pointer in memory.
