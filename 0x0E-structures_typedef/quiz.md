> Structures and Typedef quizes

#### Question #0
The general syntax for a struct declaration in C is:
```c
struct tag_name {
   type member1;
   type member2;
   /* declare as many members as desired, but the entire structure size must be known to the compiler. */
};
```
* [ ] Maybe
* [X] True
* [ ] False

#### Question #1
Those two codes do the same thing:
```c
typedef struct point point;
struct point {
   int    x;
   int    y;
};
point p = {1, 2};
```
```c
typedef struct point point;
struct point {
   int    x;
   int    y;
};
point p = { .y = 2, .x = 1 };
```
* [ ] False: the members of the structures will not have the same values
* [X] True
* [ ] False: the second does not compile

#### Question #2
You should write documentation for all the structures you create

* [X] As soon as I write my structure.
* [X] True
* [ ] Iâ€™ll do it 5 minutes before the deadline when I try Betty on my header file
