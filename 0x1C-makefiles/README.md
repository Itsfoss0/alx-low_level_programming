## About
A makefile is a script that automates the building of a program from source code. In the case of C programs, a makefile typically includes instructions for compiling the source code into object files and linking those object files into an executable program. Makefiles can greatly simplify the build process by automating repetitive tasks and allowing developers to easily manage complex build configurations. In this context, C makefiles provide a way to manage the build process for C programs in a structured and efficient manner. Hang tight as we dive into making makefiles. ^_^
